        <p>Joinpoint models characterize trends over calendar time.
        The joinpoint model consists of linear segments connected
        through join points. The number and location of join points
        are estimated from data, and represent the times at which
        trends changed.</p>

        <p>The JPSurv software has been developed to analyze trends
        in survival with respect to year at diagnosis. Survival
        data includes two temporal dimensions that are important to
        account for: the calendar year at diagnosis and the time
        since diagnosis. The JPSurv fits a <b>Joinpoint
        survival</b> model to the hazard of cancer death by year at
        diagnosis and assumes a common baseline hazard by time
        since diagnosis. In other words, the probabilities of dying
        at different time interval, e.g., 1 to 2 years, 2 to 3
        years, and 4 to 5 years since diagnosis are proportional
        and share the same join points. The software uses
        discrete-time survival data, i.e. survival data grouped by
        years since diagnosis in the life table format. The
        software accommodates both relative survival and
        cause-specific survival. (Need to check this).</p>

        <p>The JPSurv tool is useful to estimate when and how much
        survival changed over time and to predict survival into the
        future for simulation studies and scenario analyses.</p>

        lost to follow-up, and interval expected survival in the
